# Automated Report Generation

## Overview
The **Automated Report Generation** project is a Python-based solution that reads data from a file, analyzes it, and generates a well-structured PDF report. This project demonstrates data processing, analysis, and report automation using Python libraries such as **pandas** and **ReportLab**.

## Features
- **Data Reading**: Reads structured data from a CSV file.
- **Data Analysis**: Extracts key insights, including summary statistics.
- **PDF Report Generation**: Formats the data analysis into a structured PDF.
- **Automated Workflow**: Runs as a single script to process and generate reports.

## How It Works
1. **Read Data**: The script reads data from a `CSV` file.
2. **Analyze Data**: It extracts key insights such as total entries, column names, and sample data.
3. **Generate PDF**: The report is formatted and saved as a `PDF` file in the `reports/` directory.
